# Object Tracking

Object tracking implemented with YOLOv4, DeepSort, and TensorFlow. YOLOv4 is a state of the art algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detections. We can take the output of YOLOv4 feed these object detections into Deep SORT in order to create a highly accurate object tracker.
